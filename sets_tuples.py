# # Sets##################################
# # Sets are unordered collections of unique elements
# # Sets are mutable
# # Sets are defined by curly braces {}
# #example of sets
# set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # set of integers
# set2 = {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}  # set of strings
# set3 = {1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana'}  # mixed set
# set4 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}  # duplicate elements are removed


# #access elements in a set
# print(set1) # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
# print(1 in set1) #Output: True
# print(6 in set1) #Output: False
# print("apple" in set2) #Output: True 
# print("banana" in set3) #Ouput: True
# # you cannot access elements in a set by index because sets are unordered 
# # instead you can convert the set into a list and access elements by index
# # we use sets when we want to store unique elements
# # and we don't care about the order of elements
# # and we do not want the elements to be changed

# # add elements to a set
# print(set1.add(6))
# print(set2.add('orange'))
# print(set3.add('strawberry'))
# print(set4.add(6))

# #remove elements from a set
# print(set1.remove(6))
# print(set2.remove('orange'))

# #check if an element is in a set
# print(1 in set1)

# #find the length of a set
# print(len(set1))

# #clear a set
# print(set1.clear)
# print(set3.clear)


# #tuples##################################
# # Tuples are ordered collections of elements
# # Tuples are immutable
# # Tuples are defined by parentheses ()
# #example of tuples
# tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # tuple of integers
# tuple2 = ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')  # tuple of strings
# tuple3 = (1, 2, 3, 'apple', 'banana')  # mixed tuple
# tuple4 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # duplicate elements are allowed

# #access elements in a tuple
# print(tuple1)
# print(tuple1[0])
# print(tuple2[1])
# print(tuple3[3])

# #find the length of a tuple
# print(len(tuple1))
# print(len(tuple2))

# #count the number of occurrences of an element in a tuple
# print(tuple4.count(1))
# print(tuple4.count(5))

# #find the index of an element in a tuple
# print(tuple2.index('banana'))
# print(tuple2.index('cherry'))

# #convert a tuple to a list
# print(list(tuple1))

# #convert a list to a tuple
# print(tuple(list1))

text = """Voil√†! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate.
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation
of a by-gone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and
vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.


The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day
vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous.


Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it is my very good honor to meet you
and you may call me V."""
